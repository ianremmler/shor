thor
====

Thor is a textual hierarchical ordered representation for data.

I couldn't find a language that did what I wanted, so I made a new one.  The
features of thor include:

* Humans and machines can read and write it
* Easy to parse
* Hierarchical
* Order is preserved
* Repeated keys
* Simple types
* Key/value and list style collections

Currently the thor command only parses input and dumps it back out.
